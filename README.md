# Neurocomputation with Geometric Algebra  
### Steven Shepard @ Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience

This is a page to consolidate information on using Geometric Algebra for computation, specifically for neural networks. 

It will distill literature and host some programming examples

# Installations 
For implementation of GA the main packages needed will be :
numpy 
clifford


simply install clifford and/or numpy with
```markdown 
pip install clifford

pip install numpy
```
or follow link for alternative download options :[https://clifford.readthedocs.io/en/latest/clifford]

### Quick Start example 
The first step in computing with GA is to define the GA space. Read this pages on GA Vectors Spaces to understand what is meant here. It may take experimentation to determine which space is ideal for your application. The spaces included in the pacakage are the following:
g2
g3
g4
g5

```markdown

import numpy as np
import clifford as cf
