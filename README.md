# Neurocomputation with Geometric Algebra  
### Steven Shepard @ Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience

This is a page to consolidate information on using Geometric Algebra for computation, specifically for neural networks. 

It will distill literature and host some programming examples


For implementation of GA the main packages needed will be :
numpy 
clifford

simply install clifford with
```markdown 
pip install clifford
```

or follow link for alternatives:https://clifford.readthedocs.io/en/latest/clifford on python 
### Markdown

```markdown

import numpy as np
import clifford as cf
